# Functions, nested loops

Project done during *Full Stack Software Engineering Studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using 'gcc 4.8.4'
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| '0-putchar.c' | Prints 'Putchar' |
| '1-alphabet.c' | Prints the alphabet in lower case |
| '2-print_alphabet_x10.c' | Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lower case |
| '3-islower.c' | Checks for lowercase character |
| '4-isalpha.c' | Checks for alphabetic character |
| '5-sign.c' | Prints the sign of a number |
| '6-abs.c' | Computes the absolute value of an integer
| '7-print_last_digit.c' | Prints the last digit of a number |
| '8-24_hours.c' | Prints every minute of the day |
| '9-times_table.c' Prints the 9 times table, starting with 0 |
| '10-add.c' | Adds two intergers and returns the results |
| '11-print_to_98.c' | Prints all natural numbers fron 'n' to 98 |
| '100-times_table.c' | Prints the 'n' times table, starting with 0 |
